## About Tiluf Studio

Set up in 2020 Tiluf is a young and emerging name in the field of metaverse and decentraland. We started with just 4 members and currently we are a a team of 18 talented and passionate developers and creators. Since a year we are working in making a mixed reality and interactive metaverse based social platform where people can play with their social avatars and can also interact with each other.

We have also created our own TLF gaming token which can be used for trading within the Tiluf app to make purchases and buy avatars.
While playing with the avarats there are several actions which can be performed, such as walking, talking, running, magic spells, flykick etc.

Currently we have crossed about 1500+ downloads over Google Playstore and Apple App Store, and with the support of Algorand we are looking forward to increase that number.
